IFFI function :-
IIFE stands for Immediately Invoked Function Expression. It is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined. An IIFE is a function expression that is defined and invoked immediately after its declaration. It's an isolated and self-contained block of code that can be used to encapsulate variables and functions, preventing them from polluting the global scope.
